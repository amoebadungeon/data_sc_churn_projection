# Telco Customer Churn Analysis
## 1. Introduction

### Background
Telecommunications companies face significant challenges in retaining customers in today's highly competitive market. Customer churn, defined as the phenomenon where customers discontinue their services, represents a critical business challenge for Telco Z. Understanding and predicting customer churn is essential for developing effective retention strategies and maintaining a stable customer base.

### Problem Statement
